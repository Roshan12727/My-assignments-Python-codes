# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the demand for rental bikes in urban cities to help bike-sharing companies optimize operations. 
The goal is to provide a stable supply of bikes, enhancing mobility and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
- **Source**: `Dataset.csv`
- **Key Features**: Weather conditions, time/date info, user counts.

## Workflow
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand data, clean, handle missing values/outliers.
2.  **Data Visualization**: Explore relationships and trends.
3.  **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, encode categorical variables.
4.  **Model Building**: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance (RMSE, MAE, R2).
7.  **Deployment**: Streamlit Application.
8.  **Presentation**: PowerPoint presentation of findings.

## Structure
- `Dataset.csv`: The raw data.
- `eda_analysis.py`: Script for initial data analysis.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models (to be created).
- `app.py`: Streamlit application (to be created).
